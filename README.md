# [JSL07] Submission: Proud of your Progress

This is the readme file for the "Proud of Your Progress Certificate Generator".

## Description

The purpose of the project was to, create a personalized certificate of achievement with the "Proud of Your Progress Certificate Generator".

## Design Choices and Functionality

I started off by fetching the form inputs by using the document.getElementbyId method, then I dynamically generate the certificate's content based on user input by creating and appending the elements to the certificate content div. Therefore when the user clicked generate certificate it would show a certificate with all the content in the modal.

## Technologies Used

\*Javascript for functionality.
